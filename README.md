## What is AssaultCube?
AssaultCube is a **FREE**, multiplayer, first-person shooter game, based on the
[CUBE engine](http://cubeengine.com/cube.php).
AssaultCube:StarDM is a branch where a number of new deatchmatch gamemodes are being tried out.

## More info:

There are four new gamemodes being proposed, specifics and nomenclature may still undergo changes!

 - RageDM (rage): you carry all weapons, ammo boxes pickups replenish your current weapon 
 - PackDM (pack): you carry all weapons, all ammo pickups replenish all weapons (clip/box=small/large)
 - eXtremeDM (xdm): you start with a pistol and a primary, dead players drop their primary
 - BattleDM (battle): your primary selection is limited per team; one A-ARD/10:SMG, one AD-81:Sniper Rifle, two V-19:Shotguns, two MTP-57:Assault Rifles

BattleDM is only possible as a team mode; the other three can be played in teams or as free-for-all.
